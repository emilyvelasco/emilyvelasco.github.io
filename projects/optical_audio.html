    decades allowed film to include analog sound recordings alongside the motion
    pictures that they carried.</p>

  <p>This project began when a friend gave me a pair of 16mm film projectors she
    was getting rid of while downsizing for a move. Because I wanted to try
    actually using them, I purchased a batch of film reels for them off eBay
    (meeting the seller in a parking lot to pick my reels out of hundreds he had
    in the trunk of his car).</p>

  <p>When I got the reels home, I looked them over and realized they each had a
    small strip with a squiggly line running down one side of the film. It had
    never before occurred to me how sound was recorded on film, but that’s what
    I was looking at. That squiggly line was an on-film, optical representation
    of the sound meant to accompany the movie.</p>

    alt="A photo showing optical sound tracks on film.">

  <p>I was left with two questions: 1) Why was sound recorded this way? And 2)
    Could I figure out a way to play back one of these audio tracks? (Neither of
    my projectors was designed for audio playback.)</p>

  <p>Let’s address the first question first, since it’s the simpler one to
    answer. Optical sound is just one of many technologies, ranging from
    scratches on wax cylinders to tiny dots read by lasers, that have been
    contrived over the years for recording audio.</p>

  <h3>Recording sound with light</h3>

  <p>Even though basically no one alive today was around during the early days
    of cinema, most of us are probably familiar with the fact that the first
    movies were silent. This is because film is an optical medium: It records
    light, and sound ain’t light, so you can’t record sound with film, at least
    not without getting creative.</p>

  <p>A variety of solutions to this problem were developed over the years, but
    the one that stuck was the squiggly strip I found on my reels. You can read
    more about how optical sound works <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_sound">here</a>, but
    essentially, it records sound as a line of varying width. Now, put a light
    source on one side of the that line and as the film slides past, a varying
    amount of light will be allowed to pass through to the other side. If you
    put a sensor in the path of that varying beam of light, you have now
    translated the information stored in that strip into an electrical signal,
    one that can be used to drive a speaker.</p>

  <p>To make this work, though, you need one other thing: A narrow slit for the
    light to shine through. If you think about how sound works, it makes sense
    why this is required. If you’re listening to a friend talking about how
    their boss is a sociopath, for example, you are only hearing the sound
    they’re making right at that very moment in time. You’re not hearing what
    they said a second ago, or what they will be saying one second in the
    future. You’re only hearing the sounds they’re making right now. If we want
    to convert optical sound back into audible sound, we need to make sure our
    device is only playing back the sound from a single point in time, or as
    near to that as we can get. This is what the narrow slit does. By blocking
    out the sound from before and after, we are only hearing the sound from
    right now. The narrower the slit, the sharper the sound we hear. Of course,
    if you make the slit too narrow, not enough light will pass through it to be
    usable, so this becomes a balancing act.</p>

  <h3>Finding the right light sensor</h3>

  <p>My first attempts to create something that could play back optical sound
    were crude and did not work very well, or really at all. An LED is a
    convenient light source and it is maybe the only part of my original design
    that remained consistent. For a light sensor, I first tried using a
    photoresistor. This didn’t work for two reasons. For one, a photocell just
    isn’t sensitive enough at the low levels of light I was working with. For
    two, it doesn’t respond quickly enough to changing light levels. One
    estimate I saw online suggested that a cadmium sulfide photoresistor has a
    response time of about 10-60 milliseconds. That means that even under the
    most generous conditions, the highest frequency response you could expect
    out of a photo resistor would be about 100 hertz, which means the vast
    majority of sound recorded on a strip of film would be lost.</p>

  <p>I then moved on to experimenting with photodiodes. These have much faster
    response times, possibly as short as 30 picoseconds. Using one of these, I
    started to hear faint sounds when I pulled a strip of film through the
    3D-printed guide I made, but the volume level was so low that it could
    barely be heard.</p>

  <p>The sensor that finally worked for me was a part called the OPT101. These
    little chips combine in a single package a rather largeish photodiode with
    something known as a transimpedance amplifier. I lack the electrical
    engineering background to explain how transimpedance amplifiers work, so
    I’ll just say the OPT101 worked for this project because it responds quickly
    and it’s very sensitive to even very low light levels.</p>

  <h3>One sound at a time, please</h3>

  <p>The sensor was only half the battle though. Creating a slit that was
    narrow, precise, and light-blocking proved to be a challenge as well. The
    original 3D-printed part had a slit, but it was not narrow enough to
    reproduce good-quality sound. Additionally, there was enough light leakage
    through the plastic itself that it was further hampering playback. I
    eventually landed on a solution in the form of two single-edge razor blades.
    This was a suggestion from my friend Kenneth, who pointed out that razor
    blades have been used to create narrow slits in light diffraction
    experiments.</p>

  <p>I redesigned the part that guides the film past the LED and the sensor so
    it held the blades, reassembled everything, and when I pulled a piece of
    film through by hand, a chill ran up my spine. Someone was speaking! I had
    succeeded in liberating a voice that had been trapped in that piece of film
    for more than half a century.</p>

  <p>That was the hard part done. I had originally set out to add audio to one
    of my film projectors, but by this point, which was several weeks after I
    started, I had decided I wanted a standalone creation. I settled on
    something that would play back audio from loops of film.</p>

  <h3>All the other bits</h3>

  <p>The film loops are pulled through by a 3D-printed drive wheel lined with
    EVA craft foam for a gentle grip, and driven by a stepper motor controlled
    by a stepper driver and an ESP32. I chose the ESP32 because it can drive a
    stepper motor at much higher frequency than can an Arduino. That matters
    because the familiar hum of a stepper motor becomes much, much louder when
    those vibrations are transmitted into the film as it passes through the read
    head. An Arduino simply wasn’t capable of providing the microstepping pulses
    fast enough for the film to run at the correct playback speed.</p>

  <h3>Final thoughts</h3>

  <p>This was a really fun project that offered a satisfying path to a final
    product. A lot of my projects hit seemingly insurmountable dead ends, or
    take a step back for every step forward, but not this one. Each change I
    made steadily improved the quality of the audio I was able to play. And when
    I finally reached the point where I could not only hear a voice coming from
    the film, but I could understand it as well, it felt a bit like making
    contact with a ghost during a séance. Too cool.</p>

  <p>One thing that could use some improvement is isolating the stepper noise
    from the film loop. The ESP32 helps a lot, but there’s still a lot of a
    high-frequency whine that gets transmitted into the audio output. If I were
    going to do this project again, I would put a flywheel on the stepper motor
    and couple the flywheel to the film drive wheel with a rubber belt.</p>
