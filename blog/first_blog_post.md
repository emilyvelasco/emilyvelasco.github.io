# First Blog post
*March 11, 2025*
For way too long I have procrastinated on startup up a blog on my website. That's mainly because I have found hand editing HTML to be way too tedious a task to do every time I want to post about a new project. 

I'm now trying out Stackedit as an option for creating blog posts.
